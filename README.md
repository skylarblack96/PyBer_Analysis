# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
PyBer is a ride-sharing app company that wants to analyze all ride-share data from January 2019 to early May 2019. The ride-share data is categorized into different city types, Urban, Suburban, and Rural. We want to compare the total weekly fares for each city type in our final analysis.

## Results
### Data Results
The ride-sharing data includes total rides, total drivers, average fare per ride, average fare per driver, and total fare by city type. Urban cities have the highest total rides, total drivers, and total fares. Rural cities have the lowest total rides, total drivers, and total fares. Although Urban cities have the highest rides, drivers, and fares, they have the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride amd average fare per driver even though their rides, drivers, and fares are the lowest. Therefore, we can assume that as the number of rides and drivers increases, the average fare per ride and driver decreases. 
### Graph Results
We can see from the graph that the end of February brings a peak in rides, drivers, and fares. In April, rides, drivers, and fares decreases for Urban and Rural cities but not Suburban. The Rural fares seem to fluctuate between $0 to $500, Suburban fares fluctuate between $550 and $1500, and Urban fares fluctuate between $1600 and $2500. Rural fares have a $500 range, Suburban fares have a $900 range, and Urban fares have a range of $900.

## Summary
The diparities between city types at PyBer suggest that there could be more drivers in Rural cities to increase total drivers and fares and decrease the average fare per ride and driver. In Urban cities there could be a decrease in drivers and fares to increase the average fare per ride and driver. The Rural fares only had a range of $500 as opposed to suburban and urban cities. The range could be increased to $900 so that all city types have the same range.
